# Ionic Starters

Ionic starters are simple apps to showcase a handful of features. In order to view these apps they must be ran from an HTTP Server, such as your localhost.
Additionally, the root of your localhost must be ran from the root of this project (mainly because the starter app's external references are to this project's `dist` folder. 

Simple way to view the examples with python:

    python -m SimpleHTTPServer

With the localhost server running from the root of this project, navigate to:

    http://localhost:8000/examples/starters/
